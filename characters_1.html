                                    OMORI is a silent protagonist. He is quite melancholic. His abilities are 
                                    reflective of this gloominess, being either violent in nature or simply gaining the SAD emotion, 
                                    or having an advantage while SAD. However, 
                                    it can be speculated that this is moreso reflective of SUNNY's emotional state, as OMORI is a character built 
                                    from SUNNY'S conscience in WHITE SPACE and HEADSPACE.

                                    She's often spoken of as being kind and gentle, and plays a sisterly role in the 
                                    friend group. She has a mischievous side, poking fun at KEL and AUBREY's 
                                    mannerisms and afterwards 
                                    teasing HERO. She also would pull pranks on HERO especially, 
                                    such as putting bugs in his school desk. It is also shown that she was a perfectionist, 
                                    spending hours at a time practicing the same piano piece over and over again.

                                    BASIL is depicted as a relatively shy and socially anxious boy, well seen right after 
                                    being introduced to the friend group, being 
                                    very insecure and fearing of being perceived as a burden. He enjoys taking pictures, 
                                    as his memories with his friends are his most 
                                    treasured belonging, perceiving them as a way to permanently capture the moment. 
                                    He also enjoys taking care of flowers, art, and reading.
