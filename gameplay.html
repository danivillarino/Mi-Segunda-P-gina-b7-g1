                                The gameplay is split between two settings, Headspace and Faraway Town. 
                                In Headspace, the player controls a party of four characters: Omori, Aubrey, 
                                Kel, and Hero. In Faraway, the player begins with only Sunny, and slowly gains 
                                party members as he reconnects with his friends. Each party member possesses their 
                                own unique skills for use both in battle and in overworld traversal.

                                Battles are played out in a turn-based format in which each party 
                                member performs a move. After attacking, party members can work 
                                together to perform "follow up" attacks. Follow ups use "Energy," 
                                a collective resource which starts at 3 at the start of each battle, 
                                and is gained when a party member takes damage, up to a maximum of 10. 
                                Characters and enemies have Heart, which functions as health points; 
                                if damage is taken, it decreases, and if it reaches zero, the character 
                                is defeated and turns into toast. The Juice meter is used to perform skills, 
                                special abilities which aid in battle.

                                    Omori utilizes a rock-paper-scissors-type system during battles 
                                    in which certain emotions are strong or weak against each other.
