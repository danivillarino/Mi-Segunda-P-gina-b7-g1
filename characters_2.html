                                    AUBREY is very cheerful and is always acting true to her feelings and 
                                    strong-willed, she serves as a 
                                    constant source of morale for her friends. Often she is clumsy, 
                                    resulting in yelling from KEL, 
                                    who she always fights with. She is also shown to be very emotional at times when 
                                    something bad happens, occasionally being too hard on herself at times, a trait that KEL takes note of.

                                    HERO is the peacemaker of the group, who tries to restrain his friends 
                                    whenever they get too worked up. He is described as having a mild personality 
                                    and passionate in domestic work like baking, cooking and cleaning. HERO also has 
                                    a charismatic side that he uses to charm 
                                    others. However, he can sometimes 
                                    be a pushover when confronted, and has difficulty refusing others. He also appears to 
                                    have arachnophobia to the point of freezing up completely.

                                    KEL is a bit bratty, impulsive and rude, always getting into 
                                    little tiffs with his friends. He is very competitive by nature, 
                                    always wanting to win games or races, and is indeed very energetic and 
                                    fast. He also thinks romance is gross. 
                                    However, even though he is loud and likes to annoy his friends, he 
                                    genuinely cares about them to the point of constantly protecting them with 
                                    a strong sense of justice.
